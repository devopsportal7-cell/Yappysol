# Transaction Detection Debugging - Enhanced Logging

## Summary

Added **detailed logging** to track why transactions aren't being stored in the database.

## What Was Added

### 1. Start of `checkForExternalDeposits` Method (Line 76)
```typescript
logger.info(`[EXTERNAL_TX] Checking for external deposits for wallet: ${walletAddress}`);
```

### 2. After Fetching from Helius (Lines 85-90)
```typescript
logger.info(`[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetched ${transactions.length} total transactions from Helius`);

if (transactions.length === 0) {
  logger.warn(`[EXTERNAL_TX] No transactions returned from Helius for wallet: ${walletAddress}`);
  return [];
}
```

### 3. During Incoming Transaction Filtering (Lines 93-111)
- Logs each filter reason (not incoming, not finalized, has error)
- Shows count of incoming transactions found

### 4. During External Transaction Filtering (Lines 114-122)
- Logs if transaction is internal vs external
- Shows count of external transactions found

### 5. During Conversion (Lines 126-139)
- Logs when new transaction is found
- Logs if transaction already exists in database
- Logs if conversion fails

### 6. Enhanced `getRecentTransactions` Method (Lines 287-304)
```typescript
logger.info(`[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetching transactions from Helius for wallet: ${walletAddress}`);
logger.info(`[EXTERNAL_TX] Helius API response status: ${response.status}`);

if (!response.ok) {
  const errorText = await response.text();
  logger.error('[EXTERNAL_TX] Helius API error', { 
    status: response.status, 
    statusText: response.statusText,
    errorText,
    walletAddress 
  });
}

logger.info(`[EXTERNAL_TX] Received ${Array.isArray(transactions) ? transactions.length : 0} transactions from Helius`);
```

## What These Logs Will Tell Us

### Scenario 1: Helius API Issues
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetching transactions from Helius for wallet: ABC...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Helius API response status: 429
[EXTERNAL_TX] Helius API error: Too Many Requests
```
**Issue:** Helius API is rate limiting us

### Scenario 2: No Transactions Fetched
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetching transactions from Helius for wallet: ABC...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetched 0 total transactions from Helius
[EXTERNAL_TX] No transactions returned from Helius
```
**Issue:** Wallet has no transactions or Helius isn't returning them

### Scenario 3: Transactions Filtered Out
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetched 5 total transactions from Helius
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 0 incoming transactions
```
**Issue:** `isIncomingTransaction` logic is too strict

### Scenario 4: All Transactions Are Internal
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 3 incoming transactions
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 0 external transactions
```
**Issue:** `isExternalTransaction` is filtering everything out (platform wallets list too broad)

### Scenario 5: Transaction Already Exists
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] New external transaction found: ABC123...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Transaction ABC123... already exists in database
```
**Issue:** Transaction was detected before but isn't showing

### Scenario 6: Conversion Fails
If you see:
```
[EXTERNAL_TX] New external transaction found: ABC123...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Failed to convert transaction ABC123...
```
**Issue:** `convertToExternalTransaction` logic has a bug

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes**
2. **Transfer SOL to a wallet**
3. **Check backend logs** and look for `[EXTERNAL_TX]` entries
4. **Share the logs** so we can identify the exact issue

## Expected Log Flow for Success

```
[EXTERNAL_TX] Checking for external deposits for wallet: ABC...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetching transactions from Helius for wallet: ABC...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Helius API response status: 200
[EXTERNAL_TX] Received 5 transactions from Helius
[EXTERNAL_TX] Fetched 5 total transactions from Helius
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 3 incoming transactions
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 2 external transactions
[EXTERNAL_TX] New external transaction found: XYZ789...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Found 1 new external transactions for ABC...
[EXTERNAL_TX] Stored external transaction: {signature: XYZ789..., amount: 0.5, tokenSymbol: SOL}
```

## Most Likely Issues

Based on your description:
1. **Helius API rate limiting** - Logs will show 429 errors
2. **Transactions are being filtered** - Logs will show count discrepancy
3. **Platform wallets list is too broad** - All transactions marked as internal
4. **Transaction already exists** - Conversion skipped

**The detailed logs will pinpoint the exact issue!**

This document contains all the AI prompts powering Yappy's flow, intent classification, entity extraction, and conversational responses.

---

## 1. Intent Classification Prompt

**File:** `IntentClassifier.ts` (lines 56-137)

**Purpose:** Understand what the user wants to do

```typescript
You are an intent classifier for Yappysol, a Solana DeFi chatbot. Analyze user messages SEMANTICALLY - understand MEANING, not just keywords.

CRITICAL: Use semantic understanding, not keyword matching!

ACTIONABLE INTENTS (isActionable: true):
- User wants to DO something NOW or GET their data
- Imperative commands or direct requests
- Examples: "swap SOL for USDC", "create a token called MyCoin", "what's in my wallet", "launch SuperToken"
- PRICE queries are ACTIONABLE: "how much is solana", "what's the price of SOL", "price of USDC"

QUESTION INTENTS (isActionable: false):
- User is asking HOW/WHAT/WHY about GENERAL concepts (not their personal data or current prices)
- Educational or informational queries about concepts
- Examples: "how do I swap tokens?", "what is token launching?", "can you explain swapping?"

SMART DISTINCTION - "What is my..." and Price queries:
- "what is my portfolio" â†’ PORTFOLIO intent (actionable: true) - User wants THEIR data
- "what is my balance" â†’ PORTFOLIO intent (actionable: true) - User wants THEIR data
- "how much is solana" â†’ PRICE intent (actionable: true) - User wants CURRENT price data
- "what's the price of SOL" â†’ PRICE intent (actionable: true) - User wants CURRENT price data
- "what is a token launch" â†’ GENERAL intent (actionable: false) - User asking about a concept
- "what is swapping" â†’ GENERAL intent (actionable: false) - User asking about a concept

RULE: 
- If "what is" + "my" â†’ Always actionable (user wants their data)
- If price-related + token name â†’ Always actionable (user wants current price)
- If "what is" + NO "my" + NO token name â†’ Usually general question about concepts

INTENTS (understand SEMANTICALLY, not just keywords):
- swap: User wants to trade/exchange tokens OR learn how to swap (any phrasing: "swap", "convert", "trade", "exchange", "how do I swap", "how can I swap", "can you swap", "show me how to swap")
- launch: User wants to create/mint a token OR learn how to create (any phrasing: "launch", "create", "make token", "mint", "how do I create a token", "how can I launch", "show me how to launch")
- price: User asking about token price/market data
- portfolio: User asking about THEIR OWN tokens/balance/holdings (variations: "my tokens", "what I have", "my balance", "portfolio", "holdings", "everything I own", "what's in my wallet")
- trending: User asking about trending/popular tokens
- general: General questions, help, greetings

CRITICAL SWAP/Launch TUTORIAL DETECTION:
- "how do I swap" â†’ swap intent, actionable: true (user wants to learn HOW to use the swap feature)
- "how can I swap" â†’ swap intent, actionable: true
- "can you swap" â†’ swap intent, actionable: true
- "how do I create a token" â†’ launch intent, actionable: true (user wants to learn HOW to use the token creation feature)
- "show me how to swap" â†’ swap intent, actionable: true
- These are NOT general questions - they are requests for guided tutorials within the chatbot

PORTFOLIO INTENT EXAMPLES (understand all of these):
- "what is my current portfolio" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true (user wants THEIR data)
- "what tokens do i own" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "everything i have" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "what's in my wallet" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "show me what i own" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "my balance" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "my holdings" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- "what are my assets" â†’ PORTFOLIO, actionable: true
- Any question about user's personal tokens/balance

PRICE INTENT EXAMPLES (understand all of these):
- "how much is solana right now" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- "what's the price of SOL" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- "how much is BONK" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- "price of USDC" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- "what is BONK worth" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- "how much does SOL cost" â†’ PRICE, actionable: true
- Any question asking for CURRENT price of a token

ENTITY EXTRACTION:
For swap: fromToken, toToken, amount, slippage
For launch: tokenName, tokenSymbol, description
For price: tokenSymbol, timeframe
For portfolio: timeframe
For trending: timeframe, limit

IMPORTANT: Use SEMANTIC understanding. Don't rely on exact keywords. Understand user intent.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown:
{
  "intent": "swap|launch|price|portfolio|trending|general",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "entities": {},
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "isActionable": true|false
}
```

const swapTutorialPatterns = [
  'how do i swap',
  'how can i swap', 
  'can you swap',
  'show me how to swap',
  'how to swap',
  'how do i trade'
];
```

### 4.2 Price Intent Keywords

```typescript
const pricePatterns = [
  /(price|cost|worth|value) (of|for)/,
  /how much (is|does|are)/,
  /(what's|what is|what's the) (price|cost|worth)/,
  /\b(SOL|BTC|ETH|BONK|WIF|JUP|USDC|USDT|JTO|PYTH|RAY|SAMO)\b.*\b(price|cost|worth|value|now)\b/,
  /\b(price|cost|worth|value|now)\b.*\b(SOL|BTC|ETH|BONK|WIF|JUP|USDC|USDT|JTO|PYTH|RAY|SAMO)\b/,
  /how much is \w+/,
  /what is \w+ worth/,
];

const hasPriceKeyword = lowerMessage.includes('price') || 
                       lowerMessage.includes('cost') || 
                       lowerMessage.includes('worth') || 
                       lowerMessage.includes('how much') ||

## 5. Key Features

### 5.1 Semantic Understanding

- **Intent Classification**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for semantic understanding, not keyword matching
- **Actionable vs Question**: Distinguishes between "what is my balance" (actionable) vs "what is swapping" (question)
- **Context-Aware**: Understands "how do I swap" as request for guided tutorial, not general question

### 5.2 Multi-Token Support

- **Price Queries**: Can extract multiple tokens from "price of SOL and BONK"
- **Entity Arrays**: Uses `tokenSymbols` array to handle multiple tokens
- **Comparison Logic**: AI models handle price comparisons and calculations

### 5.3 Context Interruption Detection

**File:** `ChatService.ts` (lines 523-664)

```typescript
// Check if user is interrupting the flow with a different intent
const isPortfolioQueryNow = this.isPortfolioQuery(message);
const isPriceQueryNow = this.isPriceQuery(message);
const isSwapIntentNow = this.isSwapIntent(message);
const isCreateTokenIntentNow = this.isCreateTokenIntent(message);
const isTrendingQueryNow = this.isTrendingQuery(message);

// Check if this is likely a step response (contains words that would be part of normal flow)
const isLikelyStepResponse = this.isLikelyStepResponse(message, context.currentStep);

// Only consider it an interruption if:
// 1. It's a clear different intent (portfolio, price, swap, etc.)
// 2. AND it's NOT likely a valid step response
if (isPortfolioQueryNow || isPriceQueryNow || isSwapIntentNow || isCreateTokenIntentNow || isTrendingQueryNow) {
  if (!isLikelyStepResponse) {
    isInterrupting = true;
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Step Response Validation

```typescript
private isLikelyStepResponse(message: string, currentStep: string | null): boolean {
  switch (currentStep) {
    case 'twitter':
    case 'telegram':
    case 'website':
      // URLs or "skip" are valid responses
      return /^https?:\/\//.test(message) || lowerMessage === 'skip';
    
    case 'description':
      // Any text longer than 5 chars is likely a description
      return message.length > 5;
    
    case 'name':
      // Any text 2-50 chars is likely a name
      return message.length >= 2 && message.length <= 50;
    
    case 'symbol':
      // Uppercase letters/numbers are valid
      return /^[A-Z0-9]{2,10}$/.test(message.toUpperCase()) || 
             /^[A-Za-z0-9]{2,10}$/.test(message);
    
    case 'amount':
      // Numbers are valid
      return !isNaN(parseFloat(message));
    
    default:
      // For other steps, check if it looks like a valid response
      const isQuestion = /^(what|where|when|how|why|who|which|is|are|can|could|would|should)/i.test(message);
      const isAskingForSomething = /\b(show|get|tell|give)\b/i.test(message);
      return !isQuestion && !isAskingForSomething && message.length > 1;
  }
}
```

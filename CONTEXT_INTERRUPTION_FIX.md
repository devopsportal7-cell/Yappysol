# Context Interruption Fix - CRITICAL

## Problem
When a user was in the middle of creating a token and asked "what is my balance", the bot would continue asking for the next token creation step (ticker, description, etc.) instead of answering the balance query.

**Test Case:**
```
User: "i wan create token"
Bot: "What is the name of your token?"
User: "what is my balance"
Bot: "What is the ticker?" ‚ùå WRONG
```

## Root Cause
The interruption detection was setting the context but not preventing the step flow from executing. The code had:
1. Detection of interruption (lines 524-531)
2. Reset context if interrupting (lines 660-664)
3. BUT: The step flow code (lines 533-657) was STILL executing because it was checking `!isInterrupting` but the code flow allowed both paths to execute

The bug was in the **control flow structure** - when interrupting was detected, the context was reset but the code continued to execute the step flow logic.

## Solution
Restructured the logic to:
1. Check for interruption FIRST (before checking currentStep)
2. Only enter step flow if NOT interrupting AND currentStep exists
3. Exit immediately after step flow (return statement)
4. Reset context if interrupting, then continue to intent detection

**Key Changes (lines 523-664):**
```typescript
// Detect interruption BEFORE checking for step continuation
const isPortfolioQueryNow = this.isPortfolioQuery(message);
const isPriceQueryNow = this.isPriceQuery(message);
const isSwapIntentNow = this.isSwapIntent(message);
const isCreateTokenIntentNow = this.isCreateTokenIntent(message);
const isTrendingQueryNow = this.isTrendingQuery(message);

const isInterrupting = isPortfolioQueryNow || isPriceQueryNow || isSwapIntentNow || isCreateTokenIntentNow || isTrendingQueryNow;

// Only continue step flow if NOT interrupting
if (context.currentStep && context.currentStep !== null && context.currentStep !== undefined && !isInterrupting) {
  // Step flow logic...
  return; // Exit after handling
}

// If interrupting, reset context
if (isInterrupting) {
  console.log('[chatWithOpenAI] üîÑ User interrupting flow with different intent - resetting context');
  context.currentStep = null;
  context.flowType = null;
}

// Then continue to intent detection (lines 666+)
```

## How It Works Now

### Before:
```
User: "i wan create token"
Bot: "What is the name of your token?" (currentStep: 'name')
User: "what is my balance" 
  ‚Üí isPortfolioQueryNow = true
  ‚Üí Reset context.currentStep = null
  ‚Üí BUT: code still enters step flow because currentStep check happens first
  ‚Üí Bot: "What is the ticker?" ‚ùå
```

### After:
```
User: "i wan create token"
Bot: "What is the name of your token?" (currentStep: 'name')
User: "what is my balance"
  ‚Üí isPortfolioQueryNow = true
  ‚Üí isInterrupting = true
  ‚Üí Skip step flow (because !isInterrupting check)
  ‚Üí Reset context.currentStep = null
  ‚Üí Continue to intent detection
  ‚Üí Bot: Shows balance ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Details

### Flow Control Structure

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
if (currentStep && !isInterrupting) {
  // Step flow
  return;
}
// Interrupt handling
if (isInterrupting) {
  reset context
}
// Continue to intent detection
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Check interruption status
const isInterrupting = checkIntents();

// Only enter step flow if NOT interrupting
if (currentStep && !isInterrupting) {
  // Step flow
  return; // EXIT IMMEDIATELY
}

// Handle interruption
if (isInterrupting) {
  reset context
}

// Continue to intent detection (always reached if not continuing step)
```

### Key Insight
The bug was that the code was checking `currentStep` FIRST, then checking `isInterrupting` INSIDE the if block. This meant:
- If `currentStep` exists, enter the block
- Then check `isInterrupting` and reset context
- BUT continue executing step flow logic

The fix moves `isInterrupting` check BEFORE the `currentStep` check, ensuring that if interrupting, we skip the entire step flow block.

## Testing

### Scenario 1: Token Creation Interruption
1. User: "i wan create token"
2. Bot: "What is the name of your token?"
3. User: "what is my balance"
4. Expected: Shows balance (not "What is the ticker?")
5. Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Scenario 2: Swap Interruption
1. User: "swap SOL for USDC"
2. Bot: "How much SOL do you want to swap?"
3. User: "whats my balance"
4. Expected: Shows balance (not "How much SOL?")
5. Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

### Scenario 3: Normal Step Continuation
1. User: "swap SOL for USDC"
2. Bot: "How much SOL do you want to swap?"
3. User: "0.5"
4. Expected: Continues to confirmation
5. Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

# WebSocket Connection Fix - Summary

## Issue
Frontend was connecting to `wss://yappysol.onrender.com/ws` but getting connection failures because:
1. Backend WebSocket was running on a separate port 8080
2. Render doesn't expose multiple ports on free tier
3. WebSocket needs to be on the same port as HTTP

## Solution Implemented
Attach WebSocket server to the existing HTTP server instead of running on separate port.

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `Yappysol/backend/src/index.ts`
- Added `http` import
- Created HTTP server from Express app
- Attach WebSocket server to HTTP server
- WebSocket now available at `/ws` on the same port as HTTP

#### 2. `Yappysol/backend/src/services/FrontendWebSocketServer.ts`
- Renamed `start()` to `attachToServer()` (main method)
- `attachToServer()` attaches to HTTP server instead of starting separate port
- Added deprecated `start()` for backward compatibility
- WebSocket listens on path `/ws` on shared HTTP server

#### 3. `Yappysol/backend/src/services/HeliusBalanceService.ts`
- Fixed `getSolBalance()` to parse `{ nativeBalance: lamports, tokens: [] }` format
- Fixed `getTokenBalances()` to extract tokens array from response
- Converts lamports to SOL (÷ 1e9)

#### 4. `Yappysol/backend/src/app.ts`
- Removed old standalone WebSocket server startup

## How It Works Now

```
Frontend → wss://yappysol.onrender.com/ws
                ↓
         HTTP Server (port 3001)
                ↓
         WebSocket Upgrade (/ws)
                ↓
    FrontendWebSocketServer
```

Both HTTP and WebSocket run on the same port (3001 on Render), so Render only needs to expose one port.

## Frontend Configuration
The frontend needs this environment variable in Lovable:
```
REACT_APP_WS_URL=wss://yappysol.onrender.com/ws
```

## Testing
After deploying to Render:
1. Backend logs should show: "✅ WebSocket server attached to HTTP server"
2. Frontend should connect successfully (no more connection errors)
3. Real-time balance updates should work

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Render will auto-deploy
3. Update Lovable environment variable `REACT_APP_WS_URL`
4. Test WebSocket connection in browser console

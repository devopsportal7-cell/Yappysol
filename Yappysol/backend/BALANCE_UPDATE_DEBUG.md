# Why Frontend Balance Didn't Update

## What the Logs Show

### Backend Status:
```
[HELIUS] Portfolio fetched: 0.005 SOL ($0.998)
[CACHE] Updated cache: 0.005 SOL ($0.998)
[Frontend WS] Portfolio update broadcasted { sentToClients: 2 }
```

### Frontend Status:
- Showing: 0.01 SOL ($1.00)
- **Does not match backend!**

## Possible Causes

### 1. Cache Issue (Most Likely)
The frontend might be showing **OLD** cached data.

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Or clear browser cache
3. Or close and reopen the app

### 2. WebSocket Not Receiving Update
Check browser console (F12) for:
- WebSocket connection errors
- Console logs about balance updates

### 3. Balance API Returning Wrong Data
The frontend might be calling `/api/portfolio` which returns cached data.

**Check:**
```bash
curl https://yappysol.onrender.com/api/portfolio?wallet=9yQvxn1h2hDdHkhLxaY3UUFQPTyPvY1DhaMfqyZb1TPN
```

## About the Error

```
error: [EXTERNAL_TX] Error checking external deposits
```

**This is NOT critical** because:
1. ✅ Transaction already stored by webhook
2. ✅ Balance already updated
3. ✅ Frontend webhook notification sent

This error happens when the **balance refresh** tries to double-check for transactions. It's safe to ignore for now.

## Quick Test

Send **another** small transaction (like 0.001 SOL) and check:
1. Does the frontend update?
2. Does the new transaction appear in the database?
3. What does the log show?

This will help us determine if it's a cache issue or a real problem.

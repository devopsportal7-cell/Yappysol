# Balance Update Summary

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Webhook receives transaction**: ✅
2. **Transaction stored in database**: ✅
3. **Balance cached in backend**: ✅ (0.005 SOL = $0.998)
4. **WebSocket sent to frontend**: ✅

## ⚠️ Issue: Frontend Showing Different Balance

**Backend Cache:**
- 0.005 SOL
- $0.998

**Frontend Showing:**
- 0.01 SOL  
- $1.00

**Difference:**
- Frontend is showing MORE than backend (2x difference)

## Possible Reasons

### 1. Frontend Cache (Most Likely)
The frontend might have cached the old balance.

**Fix:** Hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

### 2. Multiple Transactions
Maybe there were 2 transactions of 0.005 each = 0.01 total?

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM external_transactions 
WHERE recipient = '9yQvxn1h2hDdHkhLxaY3UUFQPTyPvY1DhaMfqyZb1TPN'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 3. Frontend Not Polling
Frontend only fetches on mount, not listening to WebSocket.

**Check:** Does frontend have WebSocket listener for portfolio updates?

## About the Error

```
error: [EXTERNAL_TX] Error checking external deposits
```

**This is NOT critical** - it's a fallback check that failed. The webhook already stored the transaction successfully.

## Quick Fix

Try hard refresh first, then check database:

```sql
SELECT 
    signature,
    amount,
    created_at
FROM external_transactions 
WHERE recipient = '9yQvxn1h2hDdHkhLxaY3UUFQPTyPvY1DhaMfqyZb1TPN'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This will show you ALL recent transactions to that wallet.

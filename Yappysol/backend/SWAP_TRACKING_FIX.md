# Swap Tracking Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Swap Not Being Logged to Database
**Problem**: Swaps via Solana Tracker weren't being logged to the `swap_transactions` table.

**Solution**: Added `swapTrackingService.recordSwap()` call after successful Solana Tracker swaps, logging:
- userId
- walletAddress
- fromToken/toToken
- signature
- status: 'success'
- provider: 'solanatracker'

### 2. Missing Balance Update After Swap
**Problem**: Wallet balance wasn't refreshing after swaps completed.

**Solution**: Added `requestWalletRefresh()` call to trigger portfolio refresh after successful swaps. This:
- Fetches latest portfolio from Helius
- Updates the balance cache
- Emits WebSocket notifications to frontend
- Includes all SPL tokens in the response

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Swap Logging**: Check the `swap_transactions` table - you should see your successful swap with:
   - Your signature from the Solana Tracker swap
   - Status = 'success'
   - Provider = 'solanatracker'

2. **Balance Update**: After a successful swap:
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for refresh to complete
   - Check your wallet - you should see:
     - Your new token (USDC/USDT from the swap)
     - Updated SOL balance
     - All SPL tokens in your portfolio

# Webhook Fixed - Now Processing Transactions

## Problem

The webhook was receiving data from Helius but marking it as "Invalid webhook payload" because:
- Helius sends: `{ body: [array of transactions] }`
- Code expected: `{ accountData, transaction }`

## Solution

Updated the webhook handler to parse the correct Helius payload structure:

```typescript
// Now handles this structure:
{
  body: [
    {
      signature: "4nQVzPsoj...",
      nativeTransfers: [...],
      tokenTransfers: [...],
      timestamp: 1761657843,
      slot: 376364786
    }
  ]
}
```

## What Was Changed

1. **Added `processTransaction()` function** - Parses each transaction from Helius
2. **Modified main handler** - Extracts transactions from `req.body.body` array
3. **Fixed data flow** - Now correctly extracts `nativeTransfers` and `tokenTransfers` from each transaction

## Expected Behavior Now

When Helius sends webhook notifications, you should see:

```
[WEBHOOK] Helius webhook received { bodyKeys: ['body'] }
[WEBHOOK] Processed transactions { count: 1 }
[WEBHOOK] Native SOL transfer processed
```

Transactions will now be stored in the database and balance will update!

## Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Helius webhook payload parsing"
git push
```

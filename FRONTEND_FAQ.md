# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. How do I use the AI chat interface to perform actions?

**Q: How can I interact with Yappysol's AI assistant?**

The AI chat interface is the main way to interact with Yappysol. Simply type your request in natural language, and the AI will understand and guide you through the process.

**Examples of what you can ask:**
- "Swap 5 SOL for USDC"
- "Create a token called MoonDoge"
- "Show me my portfolio"
- "What are the trending tokens?"
- "Check the price of SOL"

The AI understands context from your conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions without repeating information. For multi-step processes like token creation or swapping, the AI will guide you through each step and display transaction details for you to review and sign.

Creating a token is simple! Just ask the AI in chat:

   - Token name
   - Token symbol
   - Initial supply or amount to invest
   - Optional: Upload a token image/logo
   - Optional: Social media links (Twitter, Telegram, Website)

## 3. How do I swap tokens?

**Q: How can I exchange one token for another?**

Swapping tokens is as easy as asking in the chat:

1. **Request a swap**: Type something like "Swap 10 SOL for USDC" or "Exchange 100 BONK for SOL"
2. **Review quote**: The AI will show you:
   - Current exchange rate
   - Amount you'll receive
   - Network fees
   - Slippage protection settings
3. **Confirm**: Review the transaction details and sign when ready
4. **Track**: The swap will appear in your activity log and update your portfolio automatically

**Tips:**
- Use Jupiter DEX for the best rates (automatic)
- Higher slippage tolerance = faster execution
- Always review the "You'll receive" amount before signing

## 4. Why isn't my balance updating?

**Q: My balance shows an old amount even after making transactions. What's wrong?**

Your balance should update automatically when:
- You receive funds from an external wallet
- You complete a swap or token creation
- A transaction is confirmed on the blockchain

**If your balance isn't updating:**

1. **Wait a few seconds**: Balance updates happen in real-time but may take 5-10 seconds to reflect
2. **Check the activity log**: If you see your transaction in the activity log, the balance update is processing
3. **Refresh the page**: In rare cases, a manual refresh may be needed
4. **Verify on Solscan**: Check your wallet address on Solscan.io to confirm the transaction

**Note:** Balance updates happen automatically via WebSocket connections. If transactions appear in your activity log but balance hasn't updated after 30 seconds, try refreshing the page.

Yes! Yappysol supports multiple wallet management:

**Automatic Wallet:**
- A secure wallet is automatically created when you sign up
- Private keys are encrypted and stored securely

**Import Existing Wallet:**

**Security Tips:**
- Never share your private keys with anyone
- Always verify transactions before signing
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

## 6. What information can I see in the activity log?

**Q: What transactions and activities are tracked in my activity log?**

The activity log shows a complete history of all your on-chain activities:

**Transaction Types Shown:**
- **Token Swaps**: All token-to-token exchanges
- **Token Launches**: Every token you've created
- **External Transactions**: 
  - Funds received from other wallets
  - Funds sent to other wallets
- **Status Information**: 
  - Pending (waiting for confirmation)
  - Confirmed (completed successfully)
  - Failed (transaction rejected or failed)

**Information Displayed:**
- Transaction timestamp
- Amount and token symbol
- Transaction signature (click to view on Solscan)
- USD value at time of transaction
- Transaction direction (Sent/Received)

**Note:** Very small "dust" transactions (less than 0.00001 SOL) are automatically filtered out to keep your activity log clean and focused on meaningful transactions.

The activity log updates in real-time, so new transactions appear automatically without refreshing the page.

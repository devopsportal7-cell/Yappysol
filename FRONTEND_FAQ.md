# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. How do I use the chat to do things?

**Ask me anything!** Just type what you want in the chat box, like you're talking to a friend.

**Try these:**
- "Swap 5 SOL for USDC"
- "Create a token called MoonDoge"
- "Show my portfolio"
- "What tokens are trending?"
- "How much SOL do I have?"

I'll guide you through everything step-by-step. For transactions, I'll show you exactly what's happening and ask you to approve before anything happens.

## 2. How do I create my own token?

Creating a token is super easy! Just tell me in the chat:

1. Say something like: **"Create a token called [YourTokenName]"**
2. I'll ask you for:
   - The token name
   - A short symbol (like "MOON")
   - How much SOL you want to invest
   - (Optional) Upload an image for your token
   - (Optional) Add links to Twitter, Telegram, or your website
3. I'll show you everything before you pay - you'll see the fees and what you'll get
4. Sign the transaction when you're ready
5. Done! Your token is live and will show up in your portfolio

**Need to know:**
- It costs about 0.015 SOL to create a token (for fees and initial setup)
- Your token goes live on Solana immediately after confirmation
- You can create tokens on Pump.fun or Bonk.fun

## 3. How do I swap one token for another?

Just ask! For example:

- **"Swap 10 SOL for USDC"**
- **"Exchange 100 BONK for SOL"**

Here's what happens:
1. I'll find you the best price available
2. I'll show you:
   - How much you'll get back
   - All the fees
   - The current exchange rate
3. Review everything and sign if it looks good
4. The swap happens instantly and shows up in your activity log!

**Pro tip:** I automatically use Jupiter DEX which finds you the best prices from all exchanges. Always double-check the "You'll receive" amount before signing!

## 4. My balance looks wrong. Why?

Your balance updates automatically when you:
- Receive money from someone
- Complete a swap or create a token
- Make any transaction

**If it seems stuck:**

✅ **Wait 5-10 seconds** - Updates happen in real-time but sometimes take a moment  
✅ **Check your activity log** - If you see the transaction there, the balance is updating  
✅ **Try refreshing the page** - This usually fixes it  
✅ **Check Solscan** - Use the links in your activity log to verify on Solana's explorer

The balance should update by itself, but if you've waited 30 seconds and nothing changed, a quick refresh usually does the trick!

## 5. Can I use my own wallet or have multiple wallets?

**Yes to both!**

**Your Auto Wallet:**
- You automatically get a wallet when you sign up
- It's secure and all set up for you
- You can use it right away

**Import Your Wallet:**
- Go to Settings
- Click "Import Wallet"
- Enter your private key or seed phrase
- Done! Your wallet is now in the app

**Multiple Wallets:**
- You can add as many wallets as you want
- Switch between them anytime
- Each wallet has its own balance and transaction history

**Keep it safe:**
- ⚠️ Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone
- ⚠️ Always check transaction details before signing
- ⚠️ Consider using a hardware wallet for large amounts

## 6. What does the activity log show?

The activity log is like your transaction history. It shows everything you've done:

**What's included:**
- ✅ All your token swaps
- ✅ Every token you've created
- ✅ Money you received from others
- ✅ Money you sent to others
- ✅ Whether transactions are pending, confirmed, or failed

**For each transaction, you'll see:**
- When it happened
- How much and what token
- Click to view it on Solscan (blockchain explorer)
- How much it was worth in USD
- Whether you sent or received it

**Keep it clean:**
- Very tiny transactions (dust) are automatically hidden
- Only meaningful transactions are shown
- Updates happen instantly - no refresh needed!

## Still need help?

- Ask me in the chat: **"How can I help?"** or **"What can you do?"**
- Click any transaction in your activity log to see it on Solscan
- Check your transaction details carefully before signing

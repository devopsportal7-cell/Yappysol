# Whitelisted Wallet Send Functionality - Status Report

## ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

After thorough codebase search, **sending to external, whitelisted wallets has NOT been implemented**.

## What EXISTS:

### ✅ Whitelist Management Infrastructure
- **Model**: `WhitelistedAddressSupabase.ts` - Full CRUD operations for whitelisted addresses
- **Controller**: `WhitelistedAddressController.ts` - REST API endpoints
- **Routes**: `/api/user/whitelisted-addresses` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, CHECK)
- **Database**: `whitelisted_addresses` table with:
  - `id` (UUID)
  - `user_id` (UUID)
  - `address` (TEXT) - Solana wallet address
  - `label` (TEXT, optional) - User-friendly label like "My Main Wallet"
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### ✅ Whitelist API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/user/whitelisted-addresses           - Get all whitelisted addresses
POST   /api/user/whitelisted-addresses           - Add new whitelisted address
PUT    /api/user/whitelisted-addresses/:id       - Update whitelisted address
DELETE /api/user/whitelisted-addresses/:id       - Delete whitelisted address
POST   /api/user/whitelisted-addresses/check     - Check if address is whitelisted
```

### ✅ Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS whitelisted_addresses (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    label TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## What's MISSING:

### ❌ No Send/Transfer Implementation
- No endpoint to send SOL/tokens to whitelisted addresses
- No whitelist validation in any transaction flow
- No restriction that forces users to only send to whitelisted addresses
- No security layer that validates recipient addresses against whitelist

### ❌ No Integration with Existing Features
Even though the system has:
- Token swap functionality (`TokenSwapService.ts`)
- Token creation (`TokenCreationService.ts`)
- External transaction detection (`ExternalTransactionService.ts`)

**None of these check against whitelisted addresses before executing.**

## What WOULD Need to Be Implemented:

### 1. Send Endpoint
```typescript
// POST /api/wallet/:address/send
{
  "recipient": "Whitelisted wallet address",
  "amount": 1.5,
  "token": "SOL" or "TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS",
  "memo"?: "Optional memo"
}
```

### 2. Whitelist Validation
```typescript
// In any send/transfer operation:
const isWhitelisted = await WhitelistedAddressModel.isAddressWhitelisted(
  userId, 
  recipientAddress
);

if (!isWhitelisted) {
  throw new Error('Recipient address must be whitelisted');
}
```

### 3. Service Layer
```typescript
// New file: src/services/TransferService.ts
export class TransferService {
  async sendToWhitelistedAddress(
    walletId: string,
    recipientAddress: string,
    amount: number,
    tokenMint: string
  ) {
    // 1. Validate recipient is whitelisted
    // 2. Check sender has sufficient balance
    // 3. Create and sign transaction
    // 4. Submit to network
    // 5. Track in database
  }
}
```

### 4. Frontend Integration
- UI to show whitelisted addresses
- Dropdown/autocomplete with whitelisted addresses only
- Validation to prevent sending to non-whitelisted addresses

## Current Capabilities:
- ✅ Users can add/remove whitelisted addresses
- ✅ Users can label their whitelisted addresses  
- ✅ System can check if an address is whitelisted
- ❌ Users CANNOT actually send funds to whitelisted addresses
- ❌ System does NOT enforce whitelist-only sending
- ❌ No security layer preventing sending to non-whitelisted addresses

## Recommendation:

If you want to implement sending to whitelisted addresses:

1. **Create Transfer Service** (`src/services/TransferService.ts`)
   - Implement SOL transfers
   - Implement SPL token transfers
   - Add whitelist validation
   - Add balance checks
   - Sign and submit transactions

2. **Add Transfer Routes** (`src/routes/transfer.ts`)
   - POST `/api/transfer/send`
   - GET `/api/transfer/history`
   - With authentication middleware

3. **Update Frontend**
   - Add send/transfer UI
   - Show whitelisted addresses dropdown
   - Validate recipient addresses

4. **Integrate with Chat**
   - Add "send" intent handler
   - Multi-step flow (select whitelisted address, amount, confirmation)
   - Similar to existing swap/launch flows

## Security Considerations:

If implementing whitelist-only sending:
- ⚠️ This would be a **major restriction** on user functionality
- Users could only send to pre-approved addresses
- Could impact legitimate use cases
- Might want "force whitelist" as a user setting rather than hard requirement
